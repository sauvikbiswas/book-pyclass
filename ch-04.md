# Attributes and memory

Let us create a class, instantiate it and populate it with two attributes.
```python
class A(object):
    pass

a = A()
a.x = 12
a.y = 13

print('a.x = %d; a.y = %d' % (a.x, a.y))
```
```
>>> a.x = 12; a.y = 13
```

It will be interesting to check what are the attributes of this instance `a` -

```python
print(dir(a))
```
```
>>> ['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', 
    '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', 
    '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__',
    '__sizeof__', '__slots__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', 'x', 'y']
```

In this example, we have created the attributes `x` and `y` on-the-fly. Python provides no restrictions over what can be created and also at what point an attribute has to be created. These attributes that are associated on-the-fly to an instance are stored in `__dict__`

```python
print(a.__dict__)
```
```
>>> {'x': 12, 'y': 13}
```

It is possible to attach a function to the instance but it must be noted that there would be no binding (using `self`) of the function to the instance object. Say, we write

```python
def print_xy(self):
    print(self.x)
    print(self.y)
    return

a.print_xy = print_xy

print(a.__dict__)
```
```
>>> {'x': 12, 'y': 13, 'print_xy': <function print_x at 0x00665A08>}
```
    
While we have attached the function, we have not bound it to the instance object.

```python
a.print_xy()
```
```
>>> Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: print_x() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'
```

In other words, `print_xy` behaves like a static method. The following works, as the instance `a` (as argument to the function call) is explicitly bound to `self`.

```python
a.print_xy(a)
```
```
>>> 12
    13
```

This is no different from calling `print_xy(a)` which was already there in the default namespace instead of copying it to namespace of `a` and calling it as `a.print_xy(a)`. It is possible to redefine `print_xy` and thus have a new definition of `print_xy` in the default namespace while the old definition is still preserved inside `a`. There can be a usecase where attribute values and function definitions change dynamically and the user is interested in storing the history of these function definitions.

## Slots

The ability to expand an instance with many objects at will may appear to be very liberating but it comes with its own caveat -- the programmer has no control over how much memory an object should occupy. The solution to this is `__slots__`.

```python
class B(object):
    __slots__ = ['x','y']
    pass
```

Superficially, this is no different from the first program snippet of this section. However, a quick look into the attributes shows that something is different.

```python
b = B()
print(dir(b))
```
```
>>> ['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', 
    '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', 
    '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__',
    '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__slots__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'x', 'y']
```

There are two additions, `x` and `y` and two deletions, `__dict__` and `__weakref__`. The absence of `__dict__` means that we cannot expand the object at will. Let us try to do that.

```python
b.newvar = 'Test string'
```
```
>>> Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: 'B' object has no attribute 'newvar'
```

While it is expected that `b` is not in a position to expand, what is also interesting is that there seems to be two predefined attributes, `x` and `y`.

```python
print(b.x)
```
```
>>> Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: x
```

Since we have not assigned anything to `x` yet, Python throws an error. `x` and `y` at this point are nothing more than placeholders. They can be assigned to objects and can be operated upon.

```python
b.x = 12
b.y = 13
print('b.x = %d; b.y = %d' % (b.x, b.y))
```
```
>>> b.x = 12; b.y = 13
```

There is a point to be made. It is necessary to define `__slots__` during the class definition. This suppresses the creation of `__dict__` and `__weakref__`. If an object already has `__dict__`, `__slots__` loses its purpose as new objects can be placed in `__dict__`. 

Likewise, when a class definition is written using `type`, `__slots__` must be defined as a key to the dictionary of namespace.

```python
X = type('X',(object,),{'__slots__': ['x','y']})
```
