# Method resolution order

In a complex hierarchy, it is difficult to figure out what exactly should a child class inherit from its parent. Let us take a simple example.

    class A(object):
        def speak(self):
            print('Function speak has been inherited from A in object:')
            print(self)
            
    class B(object):
        def speak(self):
            print('Function speak has been inherited from B in object:')
            print(self)
            
    class C(A,B):
        pass
        
    class D(A,B):
        pass
        
    class E(C,A):
        pass
