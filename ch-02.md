# Constructors: `__new__` and `__init__`

Python has two constructors -- `__new__` and `__init__`. In Java or C++, constructors not only create objects but initialise them, too. Python has split the object creation and initialisation process. `__new__` handles object creation and `__init__` handles object initialisation. In the strictest sense, `__init__` is not a constructor.

Let us first observe how `__init__` behaves.

    class A():
    
        def __init__(self):
            print('INIT has been called')
         
    a = A()
    >>> INIT has been called
    
We can see that `__init__` is automatically called when the instance `a` of class `A` is created. This is not to say that the object hasn't been created just because `__new__` isn't there. In fact, the class automatically inherits the `__new__` attribute of Python *object*. It also possible to skip the `__init__` function altogether. In that case the `__init__` attribute of *object*, that is inherited by class `A`, is executed.

It must be pointed out that the `__init__` function must return `None`. This can be done by omitting the `return` statement altogether.

The variable `self` is a reference to the instance object. Let us modify the class to have a clearer understanding of this.

    class A():
    
        def __init__(self):
            print('INIT has been called on object:')
            print(self)
         
    a1 = A()
    >>> INIT has been called on object:
        <__main__.A instance at 0x021FE210>

    
    a2 = A()
    >>> INIT has been called on object
        <__main__.A instance at 0x021FE238>
    
In this sample output, we can observe that the variable `self` refers to two different instances of the class `A` as shown by the memory location displayed in the output. In fact, if we ask the program `print(a1)` and `print(a2)` after this, we will obtain the same two outputs. (Provided it is in the same running instance of the program -- we have no control over the memory location where the instance is created.)

Let us add a `__new__` method to this class. `__new__` is a staticmethod. The explicit declaration of this function being a staticmethod is not required as Python takes care of that. This function takes in the class itself, `cls`, as its first argument.

    class A():
    
        def __new__(cls):
            print('NEW has been called on object:')
            print(cls)
    
        def __init__(self):
            print('INIT has been called on object:')
            print(self)
            
    a1 = A()
    >>> NEW has been called on object:
        <class '__main__.N'>

    
    a2 = A()
    >>> NEW has been called on object
        <class '__main__.N'>

It is clear that `__init__` has not been called. There is a reason for that. Python checks if the `__new__` function returns an object of instance `cls` or not. Only when this condition is satisfied, Python passes the control over to `__init__` before returning the object. In the above example, the function returns `None`, which is definitely not an instance of `cls`.

A not very typical way is to construct an instance it with `object.__new__(cls)`. It is atypical in the sense that it actually does nothing useful. However, this is a much more simpler introduction to the concept than the usual fare (which we shall come to in a bit).

    class A():
    
        def __new__(cls):
            print('NEW has been called on object:')
            print(cls)
            return object.__new__(cls)
    
        def __init__(self):
            print('INIT has been called on object:')
            print(self)
            
    a1 = A()
    >>> NEW has been called on object:
        <class '__main__.N'>
        INIT has been called on object:
        <__main__.N object at 0x005138D0>

    a2 = A()
    >>> NEW has been called on object:
        <class '__main__.N'>
        INIT has been called on object:
        <__main__.N object at 0x005137F0>
