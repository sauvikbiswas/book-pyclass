# Constructors: `__new__` and `__init__`

Python has two constructors -- `__new__` and `__init__`. In Java or C++, constructors not only create objects but initialise them, too. Python has split the object creation and initialisation process. `__new__` handles object creation and `__init__` handles object initialisation. In the strictest sense, `__init__` is not a constructor.

Let us first observe how `__init__` behaves.

    class A():
    
        def __init__(self):
            print('INIT has been called')
         
    a = A()
    >>> INIT has been called
    
We can see that `__init__` is automatically called when the instance `a` of class `A` is created. This is not to say that the object hasn't been created just because `__new__` isn't there. In fact the class automatically inherits the `__new__` attribute of Python *object*. If it also possible to not write an `__init__` function at all. In that case the `__init__` attribute of *object*, that is inherited by class `A`, is executed.
