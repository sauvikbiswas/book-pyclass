# Constructors: `__new__` and `__init__`

Python has two constructors -- `__new__` and `__init__`. If a parralel is drawn from Java or C++, constructors not only create objects but initialise them, too. Python has split the object creation and initialisation process. `__new__` handles object creation and `__init__` handles object initialisation. In the strictest sense, `__init__` is not a constructor.

Let us first observe how `__init__` behaves.

    class A():
    
        def __init__(self):
            print('INIT has been called')
         
    a = A()
    >>> INIT has been called
    
We can see that __init__ is automatically called when the instance `a` of class `A` is created.
